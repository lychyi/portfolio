        Illumina's software family is a diverse ecosystem of products that run the gamut of function and form.
        When I joined the company, I joined a cross-functional team dedicated to developing a color system for web user interfaces.
        Our challenge was to create a color system that was easy to understand and use, yet flexible enough to use throughout the organization.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A color system for the web is somewhat unique.
      Color can convey important information and while providing helpful context like <span style="color: green">"success"</span> or <span style="color: crimson">"error"</span>.
      Moreover, it reflects your product's brand and can even play a critical role of promoting it (<a href="http://www.tiffany.com/" target="_blank">Tiffany <span style="color: #81d8d0">blue</span></a> for example).
      But perhaps unsurprisingly, color doesn't get the attention it deserves when designing software and relating it to the brand. 
      I mean, it's purely subjective right? 
      Without guidelines, does it matter if we're using <span style="color: #FFB441">this orange</span> or <span style="color: #FC9900">this orange</span>?
      How do we know when to use what colors for what function? 
      Can you can read <span style="color: #FFB441">this orange</span> (<code>#FFB441</code> in hex) on this background?
      If you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromacy" target="_blank">monochromacy</a> (a type of color blindness), it may be difficult.
      Can you read the following? <span style="color: #C2C2C2">"This is what a person with monochromacy would see if viewing <code>#FFB441</code>."</span>
      Probably, but you're struggling because of the contrast. Yet this is similar to what a person with monochromacy will encounter if we don't think about accessibility when choosing our colors.
    </p>
    <div class="statement">Accessibility matters.</div>
    <p>
      At Illumina, we faced challenges like this. Our brand colors were never designed for software user interfaces on the web, let alone an entire family and ecosystem of products.
      That <span style="color: #FFB441">orange color</span> we presented earlier? That's <i>Illumina Pumpkin Orange</i>, our flagship brand color.
      When we use that on software user interfaces with a light-grey background (like the one you're viewing now), we're essentially making life difficult for our color blind users. 
      And being our company's main brand color, you can easily see how it can be misused.
    </p>
    <h3>Inaccessible and inconsistent</h3>
    <p>
      Without a formal color system, software at Illumina could be designed with any color.
      It was up to the designer or developer and perhaps whatever mood they were in.
      And if you take a look at Illumina's history, you can see this in our products: inconsistent color choice and poor accessibility for all of our users.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating a color system</h2>
    <p>
      With branding and our users in mind, we decided to develop a diverse color system specifically for the web with colors complementary to our brand and at the same time, promote standardized accessibility.

    <h3>Beg, Borrow, and Steal</h3>

      Luckily, the hard part was already done by someone else. 
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Color theory and systems for web user interfaces have been reasoned about before. 
      When our team met up to discuss our approach, it immediately became clear that it was difficult to solve this in a vaccum.
      We needed some inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Color is the way which we perceive segments of the visible light spectrum.
      We're talking about things like wavelengths, contrast, luminance, hue, saturation, lightness, etc.
      In other words, the output of a complex equations. 
      We have a natural tendency to associate emotion and subjectiveness to color, but a solid color system needs to be based upon color theory and a bit of math.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, the hard part was already done by someone else. 
      The <a href="http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework/visual/color/" target="_blank">IBM Design Language</a> had neatly solved this problem.
      They had a color system with baked in accessibility and it had enough variation for a diverse palette.
      When it was all said and done, we made a few modifications but this color system unashamedly borrows from them.
    </p>
    <div class="statement">
      Thank you IBM Design.

    <h2>Accessibility comes down to contrast. Contrast is math. Make the math simple.</h2>
    <p>
      How do we create colors that help our color blind users?
      Even if you have color blindness, your eyes can distinguish between different contrast points.
      In order for us to use colors in an that way, we have to assume that the text that conveys information in our user interfaces do so with enough contrast regardless of color we choose.
      There are minimum contrast ratios prescribed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html" target="_blank">W3C</a> that define what makes text legible for all users.
      The equation is based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#relativeluminancedef" target="_blank">relative luminance</a>.
      Once you get relative luminance, you plug it into this equation:
      <code>(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)</code>.
      Where <code>L1</code> is the lighter of the two colors and <code>L2</code> is the darker of the two colors.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Having to plug colors into an equation to verify contrast for accessibility is tedious at best.
      In addition, making it difficult wouldn't do us any favors if we're trying to promote the importance of designing for accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      An easy way to solve this is to simplify the math. 
      We labeled each color in the system with a number. 
      This number corresponds to a specific relative luminance value and a designer or developer can determine what is appropriate contrast by simple subtraction.
    </p>
    <p>Something like this is much easier: </p>
    <div class="contrast-example-section">
      <div class="contrast-example">
        <h3 style="color: #FFF;"><b>Holy Cow Batman!</b></h3>
        <p>This text here passes the WCAG contrast test.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="equation-section">
        <span class="equation">
          <span class="operand"><b>Background Color:</b> Slate 70</span>
          <span class="operand"><b>Text Color: </b> Violet 20</span>
        </span>
        <span class="result">
          50 or greater means it's accessible

    <h2>How we built this.</h2>
    <h3>Pick primary hues to start</h3>
    <p>
      We started with some starting hues for our color palette.
      This is the largely subjective part and arguable the most important part in distinguishing our brand from another.
      The colors were inspired by the vibrant optical filters inside of our Illumina sequencers.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="color-spectrum">
    <div class="color-spectrum-item" *ngFor="let item of ilmnColors" [style.backgroundColor]="item"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="project-text">
    <h3>Generate shades from those hues</h3>
    <p>
      We then generated a variety of shades (we did this programmatically using <a href="https://github.com/gka/chroma.js/" target="_blank">chroma.js</a>) from these hues based on relative luminance and gave it a numerical label.
      This label corresponds to the contrast calculation we did in the example above.
      Whenever two colors have a difference of 50 or greater, we can be assured that there is enough contrast by WCAG standards to be accessible.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="color-spectrum half">
    <div class="color-spectrum-item" *ngFor="let item of shadesOfTeal" [style.backgroundColor]="item.color">
      <span class="spectrum-item-label">{{item.shade}}</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="color-spectrum half">
    <div class="color-spectrum-item" *ngFor="let item of shadesOfError" [style.backgroundColor]="item.color">
      <span class="spectrum-item-label">{{item.shade}}</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="color-spectrum half">
    <div class="color-spectrum-item" *ngFor="let item of shadesOfPurple" [style.backgroundColor]="item.color">
      <span class="spectrum-item-label">{{item.shade}}</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="project-text">
    <p>
      Each numerical label has the same relative luminance across all color hues.
      If you were to see each hue and their shades with monochromacy, they would look identical.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="color-spectrum half">
    <div class="color-spectrum-item" *ngFor="let item of shadesOfGrey" [style.backgroundColor]="item.color">
      <span class="spectrum-item-label">{{item.shade}}</span>
    </div>

  <div class="color-spectrum half">
    <div class="color-spectrum-item" *ngFor="let item of shadesOfGrey" [style.backgroundColor]="item.color">
      <span class="spectrum-item-label">{{item.shade}}</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="color-spectrum half">
    <div class="color-spectrum-item" *ngFor="let item of shadesOfGrey" [style.backgroundColor]="item.color">
      <span class="spectrum-item-label">{{item.shade}}</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="project-text">
    <h3>Bingo. Consistent, Accessible Colors</h3>
    <p>
      This results in a color system that is diverse yet consistent.
      We carefully selected colors that reflect our brand and generated enough variation for our current user interfaces and the ones to come.

      A successful color system needs to strike the right balance between form and function.
      With a bit of inspiration and code, we were able to craft a system of colors that really reflected Illumina's brand and our products well while promoting accessibility at it's core.
